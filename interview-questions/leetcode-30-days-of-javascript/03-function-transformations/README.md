## Function Composition

Composition simply means the combination of two or more functions to form a new function.
When you compose two functions, you apply one function to the output of the other function.

For example, if you have two functions f(x) and g(x), their composition would be (fâˆ˜g)(x) = f(g(x)).
This means that you first apply the function g(x) to the input x, and then apply the function f(x) to the output of g(x).
